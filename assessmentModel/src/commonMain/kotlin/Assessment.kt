 *
 * For example, a researcher may measure a participant's hand tremor by having the participant hold their phone in each
 * hand while a recorder is gathering motion sensor data. That is an [Assessment] with a measurable result of the sensor
 * data. Before taking this measurement, the participant may be asked about their medications. That is a *different*
 * [Assessment] with a measurable result of the medication timing and dosage. These two assessments are then grouped
 * together using a [Task] parent node, but that parent node does *not* have a measurable result other than a shared
 * task run uuid that can be used to determine the correlation between the medication timing and the tremor. In this
 * example, the "task run" refers to performing *both* the medication timing assessment *and* the tremor assessment.
 * While both assessments can be run independently as the root level [Task], they can also be combined into a series
