 * The [Navigator] is used by the assessment view controller or fragment to determine the order of presentation of
 * the [Step] elements in an assessment as well as when to start/stop the asynchronous background actions defined by
 * the [AsyncActionConfiguration] elements. The navigator is responsible for determining navigation based on the input
 * model, results, and platform context.
 *
 * The most common implementation of a [Navigator] will include a list of child nodes and rules for navigating the list.
 * However, the [Navigator] is defined more generally to allow for custom navigation that may not use a list of nodes.
 * For example, data tracking assessments such as medication tracking do not neatly conform to sequential navigation and
 * as such, use a different set of rules to navigate the assessment.
