/**
 * A [DistanceRecord] is a serializable object that can be used to record normalized GPS samples for use in determining
 * distance travelled.
 *
 * Record Properties:
 *   - [timestampUnix]: The Unix timestamp (seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z) when the measurement was taken.
 *   - [horizontalAccuracy]: The horizontal accuracy of the location in meters; `null` if the lateral location is invalid.
 *   - [relativeDistance]: The lateral distance between the current location and the previous location in meters.
 *   - [verticalAccuracy]: The vertical accuracy of the location in meters; `null` if the altitude is invalid.
 *   - [altitude]: The altitude of the location in meters. Can be positive (above sea level) or negative (below sea level).
 *   - [totalDistance]: Sum of the relative distance measurements if the participant is supposed to be moving.
 *   - [course]: The course of the location in degrees true North; `null` if course is invalid.
 *   - [bearingRadians]: The bearing to the location from the previous location in radians (clockwise from) true North.
 *   - [speed]: The speed of the location in meters/second; `null` if speed is invalid.
 *   - [floor]: The floor of the building where the location was recorded; `null` if floor is not available.
 *
 * Additionally, the record *may* include [latitude] and [longitude], but if and only if either this is a record for
 * a test user or if appropriate consent has been given by the participant to include sensitive location data.
