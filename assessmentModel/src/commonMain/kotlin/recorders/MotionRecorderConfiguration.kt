/**
 * [MotionRecorderType] is used to enumerate the sensors and calculated measurements that should be recorded for a
 * given assessment.
 *
 * Splitting the device motion into components in this manner stores the data using a consistent JSON schema that
 * can represent the sensor data returned by both iOS and Android devices. Additionally, this allows for representing
 * the data using a single table which can then be  filtered by type to perform calculations and DSP on the input
 * sources.
 *
 * The recorder types are split into two categories of [raw] sensor data and [calculated] values. The [calculated]
 * values are are black box values calculated by the platform libraries and may vary between devices.
 *
 * - Raw data:
 *   - [Accelerometer]: Raw accelerometer reading.
 *   - [Gyro]: Raw gyroscope reading.
 *   - [Magnetometer]: Raw magnetometer reading.
 *
 * - Calculated values:
 *   - [Attitude]: Calculated orientation of the device using the motion sensors and magnetometer (if appropriate).
 *   - [Gravity]: Calculated vector for the direction of gravity in the coordinates of the device.
 *   - [MagneticField]: The magnetic field vector with respect to the device for devices with a magnetometer.
 *   - [RotationRate]: The rotation rate of the device for devices with a gyro.
 *   - [UserAcceleration]: Calculated vector for the participant's acceleration in the coordinates of the device.

/**
 * A [MotionRecord] is a serializable implementation of a [SampleRecord] that can be used to record a sample from one
 * of the motion sensors or calculated vectors. Path markers are added to the data stream to mark step transitions
 * using this same serialization object by setting all properties on the record to null.
 *
 * Additionally, setting unused properties to `null` allows the records to all serialize as a single class type, be
 * recorded using a comma-delimited table, and does not require polymorphic serialization.
 *
 * If the [sensorType] is `null` then this is a path marker. Other values included here are only applicable to certain
 * sensors. This data structure allows for defining all records within a single file.
 *
 * Vector properties:
 * - [x]: The `x` component of the vector measurement for this sensor sample.
 * - [y]: The `y` component of the vector measurement for this sensor sample.
 * - [z]: The `z` component of the vector measurement for this sensor sample.
 * - [w]: The `w` component of the vector measurement for this sensor sample. (Used by the attitude quaternion.)
 *
 * Additional properties:
 * - [eventAccuracy]: A number marking the sensor accuracy of the magnetic field sensor.
 * - [referenceCoordinate]: Used for an [MotionRecorderType.Attitude] record type to describe the reference frame.
 * - [heading]: The angle in the range [0,360) degrees with respect to [AttitudeReferenceFrame.XMagneticNorthZVertical].
